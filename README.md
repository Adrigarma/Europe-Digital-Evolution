# Europe's Digital Evolution
In todayâ€™s interconnected world, access to the internet is no longer a luxury, but an essential tool for social participation, economic growth, and equal opportunity. One of the core objectives of the EUâ€™s digital transformation strategy is to empower citizens through access to digital technologies. However, disparities in internet access and usage persist between countries, demographic groups, and types of online activities. 

## Objective
This project generates actionable insights into digital inclusion, highlighting disparities within and between European countries.

## Key Questions
1. Who is online and what for? Explore how connected segments, countries, and regions are.  
2. Where are the gaps? Identify inequalities between populations, regions, and online activities.  
3. What patterns shape Europe's digital life? Discover which activities lead and which still lag.  

## Data
The analysis is based on Eurostat datasets covering 38 countries: EU member states, EFTA members, and candidate nations (Turkey and Kosovo). The time span of the data is 2003â€“2024, enabling both regional comparisons and trend analysis.  

**Datasets:**
- Eurostat. (n.d.). Internet activities by individuals and frequency of use (custom extraction). European Commission. Retrieved July 9, 2025, from https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/isoc_ci_ifp_fu__custom_17380066/default/table?lang=en  

- Eurostat. (n.d.). Individuals using the internet for various activities (custom extraction). European Commission. Retrieved July 9, 2025, from https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/isoc_ci_ac_i__custom_17403281/default/table?lang=en  

- Eurostat. (n.d.). Real GDP per capita in PPS (custom extraction). European Commission. Retrieved July 9, 2025, from https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/sdg_10_10__custom_17380086/default/table?lang=en  

## Tools
The analysis was performed using **Python** with the following libraries:
- **Pandas** and **NumPy** â€“ data cleaning, wrangling, and analysis  
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** â€“ statistical graphics and data visualization  
- **Plotly Express** â€“ interactive visualizations  
- **Scikit-learn** and **Statsmodels** â€“ regression models, clustering, and time series analysis  
- **Folium** â€“ interactive mapping  
- **OS** and **JSON** â€“ file management and structured data handling  

The visual storyboard was created in **Tableau** for interactive data exploration and presentation.  

## Folders
The project files are organized as follows:  
01. **Project Management** â€“ contains project documentation:  
- [Data Source Description](<01 Project Management/EDE_Data_Source.pdf>)  
- [Data Summaries](<01 Project Management/EDE_Data Summary>)  
- [Data Overview](<01 Project Management/EDE_Data Overview.xlsx>), which includes population flow, data consistency checks, and wrangling steps.  

02. **Data** â€“ contains:  
- [Original Data](<02 Data/Original Data>)  
_Note: The 'Prepared Data' folder is not included due to size constraints, but it can be generated by running the scripts in the [**Scripts**](<03 Scripts>) folder._  

03. **Scripts** â€“ Jupyter Notebooks documenting each step of the analysis.  

04. **Analysis** â€“ includes various [Visualizations](<04 Analysis/Visualizations>)
